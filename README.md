# Uiua-APL Playground with Rust

A repository for me to mess around with APL, Uiua and Rust to expand my computational thinking.

## Why?

In my journey through development I've always been fond of topics which may not apply to my everyday work, but definitely expand your way of thinking. It started when my friend introduced me to Haskell and functional programming, which gave me perspective on a new thought process towards writing code. I despise working with Haskell, but I've stumbled upon a new approach to writing algorithms with APL and its dialects of *array programming* languages. I've been feeling dry with a lot of programming that I've been working on lately. Uiua and APL have been a breath of fresh air, ironically since APL is older than most languages in use today. Their intricate, glyph-based, syntax is quite charming and keeps drawing me in. It's incredibly satisfying seeing a complex operation successfully calculate with just one line of glyphs.
